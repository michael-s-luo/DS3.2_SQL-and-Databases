# Sprint 2 Module 3 - NoSQL and Documen-Oriented Databases

NoSQL is a method we use to interact with a non-relational database. We learned how we can use SQL to interact with a relational database and now we see its counterpart today.

## Learning Objectives

* Identify appropriate use cases for document-oriented databases
* Deploy and use a simple MongoDB instance

## Before Lecture

Sign up for an account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), the official hosted service of MongoDB with a generous (500mb) free tier. You can also explore the many [MongoDB tools](http://mongodb-tools.com/) out there, though none in particular are recommended or required for installation (we're really just checking out MongoDB as a way to understand document-oriented databases. It's unlikely to become a core part of your toolkit the way SQLite and PostgreSQL may).

## Resources and Stretch Goals

Try to insert all the SQLite RPG data tables into your MongoDB cluster.

Put the Titanic data in Big Data! That is, try to load `titanic.csv` from yesterday
into your MongoDB cluster.

Push MongoDB - it is flexible and can support fast iteration. Design your own
database to save some key/value pairs for an application you'd like to work on
or data you'd like to analyze, and build it out as much as you can!
